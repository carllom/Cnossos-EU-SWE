# Cnossos-EU-SWE
This is the source code for the Cnossos-EU noise calculation model. It is not an official repository and in no way endorsed by the European Council. The code included in this repository will be subject to experimentation in order to port the noise calculation tool to be useful under linux, as well as in order to add/alter functionality suited for domestic Swedish needs.
